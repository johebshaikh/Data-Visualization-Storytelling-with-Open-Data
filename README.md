# Data-Visualization-Storytelling-with-Open-Data
Australian road fatalitites from 2015-2020

## Overview

This project explores and visualizes trends in road fatalities across Australia from 2015 to 2020. The analysis aims to provide insights into various factors contributing to road accidents, such as state-wise fatalities, time of day (day vs night), and age groups. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Australian Road Deaths Database (ARDD).

## Features
- Road Accidents Mortality Trends by State: Visualizes trends in road fatalities across different states of Australia over the years 2015-2020 using an interactive line graph.
- Day vs Night Mortality Rates: Compares the number of fatalities occurring during the day and night over the same period, using a bar chart to highlight differences.
- Age Group Analysis: Displays fatalities broken down by age group, showing trends over time to understand which age groups are most affected.

## Technologies Used
- R: Data wrangling and visualization using packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, and plotly.
- Flexdashboard: For creating an interactive and dynamic dashboard.
- Plotly: To enhance visual interactivity with hover features for data exploration.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the Australian Government's open data portal and can be accessed here. It includes detailed information on road crash fatalities across Australia.

## Visualizations
- State-wise Fatality Trends: Interactive line graph showing the total fatalities in each state per year.
- Day vs Night Fatalities: Bar chart comparing the number of accidents during the day and at night.
- Fatalities by Age Group: Line graph illustrating how fatalities are distributed across different age groups over time.
